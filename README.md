# AI Enhanced Literature Review

## Introduction

A literature review is a critical summary and evaluation of existing research on a specific topic. It helps to identify gaps in knowledge and provides a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Here are the most important steps in the literature review process.

What is the goal of the literature review:
- Determine the need for the research being proposed.
- See the extent of the work done in the area and what remains to be done.
- Identify the approaches that can be adopted in the proposed research.


## Apps
There are a number of apps that you can use to assist you in the process of constructing the content of a literature review. Every application has specific advantages as well as drawbacks. You will make more progress and improve the overall quality of your literature review if you connect the dots in a meaningful way between the different elements.

### Zotero
Zotero is a free reference manager that helps you collect, organize, cite, and share research sources. It allows you to create references and bibliographies for any text editor, including Word, LibreOffice, and Google Docs. Zotero can also synchronize your data across devices, making it easy to access your research from anywhere.

These apps can help you streamline your literature review process, making it easier to find, organize, and analyze relevant research.

## Question-Claim-Evidence (QCE) Framework

The Question-Claim-Evidence (QCE) framework is a structured approach to organizing and presenting findings in a literature review. It ensures that your review is argumentative and evidence-based rather than merely descriptive. This framework helps you build a logical chain from your research questions to your conclusions.

### The Three Components

**1. Question (Q)**
- What research question or sub-question are you addressing?
- What gap, debate, or phenomenon are you exploring?
- What do you want the reader to understand after reading this section?

**2. Claim (C)**
- What is your synthesis or conclusion about what the literature shows?
- This is your analytical statement based on multiple sources
- Claims should be clear, specific, and arguable

**3. Evidence (E)**
- What research findings support your claim?
- Cite multiple sources to support each major claim
- Include contradictory evidence and explain why conflicts exist
- Evaluate the strength and quality of the evidence

### How to Apply QCE in Literature Reviews

**Traditional approach (descriptive):**
> "Smith (2020) found that ESG ratings improve stock performance. Jones (2021) also found a positive relationship. However, Brown (2022) found no significant effect."

**QCE approach (analytical):**
> **Question**: Does ESG performance affect financial returns?  
> **Claim**: While the majority of recent empirical studies suggest a positive relationship between ESG performance and financial returns, this relationship is context-dependent and varies significantly by firm size, industry sector, and geographic region.  
> **Evidence**: Large-scale meta-analyses demonstrate a small but positive average effect (Smith, 2020; Jones, 2021), though this effect is strongest among large firms in developed markets (Martinez, 2021). Studies finding null or negative effects typically examine small firms or emerging markets where ESG data quality is lower (Brown, 2022; Chen, 2023). These conflicting findings suggest that institutional context mediates the ESG-performance relationship.

## Conclusion

Conducting a literature review is both an art and a science. It requires systematic rigor, critical thinking, and effective synthesis. By following these insights and developing a structured workflow, you can transform the literature review from a daunting task into a valuable foundation for your research. Remember: a literature review is not just about demonstrating what you've readâ€”it's about showing how you think, where your research fits, and why it matters.
